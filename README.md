This example demonstrates a common error in Groovy related to its flexible typing system.  When calling a method with parameters of different types, the order matters. Groovy will attempt to coerce the types, but if the coercion fails or results in unintended behavior, a runtime error or incorrect logic can occur. The solution provides improved type checking using explicit type checking.
